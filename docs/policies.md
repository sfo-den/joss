JOSS Policies
==========================

## Animal research policy

In the exceptional case a JOSS submission contains original data on animal research, the corresponding author must confirm that the data was collected in accordance with the latest guidelines and applicable regulations. The manuscript must include complete reporting of the data, including the ways that the study was approved and relevant details of the sample. Authors are required to report either the [ARRIVE](https://arriveguidelines.org/) or [PREPARE](https://doi.org/10.1177/0023677217724823) guidelines for animal research in the submission. 

We recommend that authors replace, reduce, and refine animal research as promoted by the [N3RS](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/).

## Data sharing policy

If any original data analysis results are provided within the submitted work, such results have to be entirely reproducible by reviewers, including accessing the data.

Submissions are, by definition, contained within one or multiple repositories, which we require authors to archive before we accept the submission. Any data contained within the software is made available accordingly.


## Human participants research policy

In the exceptional case a JOSS submission contains original data on human participants, the study must have been performed in accordance with the [Declaration of Helsinki](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/). The manuscript must contain all relevant information regarding ethics approval, including but not limited to the responsible ethics committee and reference number. This also applies to ethics exemptions. Informed consent must be collected from all human research participants, and authors are required to state whether this occurred in the manuscript.
