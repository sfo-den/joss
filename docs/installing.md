# Installing the JOSS application

Any Open Journal (JOSS, JOSE, etc.) can be considered in three parts:

1. The website
2. The Whedon gem
3. A thin API wrapper around the Whedon gem to interface with GitHub

For JOSS, these correspond to the:

1. [JOSS](https://github.com/openjournals/joss),
2. [Whedon](https://github.com/openjournals/whedon), and
3. [Whedon-API](https://github.com/openjournals/whedon-api)

code bases.

## Setting up a local development environment

All Open Journals are coded in Ruby,
with the website and Whedon-API developed as
[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/inst) applications.

If you'd like to develop these locally,
you'll need a working Ruby on Rails development environment.
For more information, please see
[this official guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails).

## Deploying your JOSS application

To deploy JOSS, you'll need a [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/).
We also recommend you gather the following information
before deploying your application to Heroku:

1. A [public ORCID API](https://members.orcid.org/api/about-public-api) key
1. A GitHub [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) for the automated account that users will interact with (e.g., `@Whedon`, `@RoboNeuro`)
1. An email address registered on a domain you control (i.e., not `gmail` or a related service)

```eval_rst
.. warning::
    Do not put these secrets directly into your code base!
    It is important that these keys are not under version control.

    There are different ways to make sure your application has access to these keys,
    depending on whether your code is being developed locally or on Heroku.
    Locally, you can store these locally in a .env file.
    The .gitignore in JOSS is already set to ignore this file type.

    On Heroku, they will be config variables that you can set either with the Heroku CLI or directly on your application's dashboard.
    See `this guide from Heroku <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#managing-config-vars>`_ for more information.
```

Assuming you [have forked the JOSS GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
to your account,
you can [configure Heroku as a git remote](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#prerequisites-install-git-and-the-heroku-cli) for your code.
This makes it easy to keep your Heroku deployment in sync with your local development copy.

On the JOSS Heroku deployment, you'll need to provision several [add-ons](https://elements.heroku.com/addons).
Specifically, you'll need:

1. [Elasticsearch add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/bonsai)
1. [PostgreSQL add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql)
1. [Scheduler add-on](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler)

For the scheduler add-on, you'll need to designate which tasks it should run and when.
These can be found in the `lib/tasks` folder, and involve things such as sending out weekly reminder emails to editors.
Each task should be scheduled as a separate job; for example, `rake send_weekly_emails`.

You can also optionally configure the following add-ons (or simply set their secret keys in your config variables):

1. [SendGrid add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/sendgrid) for sending emails
1. [Honeybadger add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/honeybadger) for error reporting

Once you've pushed your application to Heroku and provisioned the appropriate add-ons,
you're ready to update your config with the appropriate secrets.
For a list of the expected secret key names, see the `app.json` file.

```eval_rst
.. warn:
    One "gotcha" when provisioning the Bonsai add-on is that it may only set the BONSAI_URL variable.
    Make sure that there is also an ELASTICSEARCH_URL which is set to the same address.
```

We will not cover Portico, as this requires that your application is a part of the `openjournals` organization.
If you do not already have access to these keys, you can simply ignore them for now.

```eval_rst
.. note:
    One secret key we have not covered thus far is WHEDON_SECRET.
    This is because it is not one that you obtain from a provide,
    but a secret key that you set yourself.
    We recommend using something like a random SHA1 string.

    It is important to remember this key,
    as you will need it when deploying your Whedon-API application.
```

After pushing your application to Heroku, provisioning the appropriate add-ons,
and confirming that your config variables are set correctly,
you should make sure that your username is registered as an admin on the application.

You can do this on a local Rails console, by logging in and setting the boolean field 'admin'
on your user ID to True.
If you'd prefer to do this on the Heroku deployment, make sure you've logged into the application.
Then you can directly modify this attribute in the deployments Postgres database using SQL.
For more information on accessing your application's Postgres database,
see [the official docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#pg-psql).

## Making modifications to launch your own site

Some times you may not want to launch an exact copy of JOSS, but a modified version.
This can be especially useful if you're planning to spin up your own platform based on the
Open Journals framework.
[NeuroLibre](https://neurolibre.herokuapp.com) is one such example use-case.

### Modifying your site configuration

In this case, there are several important variables to be aware of and modify.
Most of these are accessible in the `config` folder.

First, there are three files which provide settings for your Rails application in different development contexts:

1. `settings-test.yml`
1. `settings-development.yml`
1. `settings-production.yml`

These each contain site-specific variables that should be modified if you are building off of the Open Journals framework.

Next, you'll need to modify the `repository.yml` file.
This file lists the GitHub repository where you expect papers to be published,
as well as the editor team ID.
For your GitHub organization, make sure you have created and populated a team called `editors`.
Then, you can check its ID number as detailed in [this guide](https://fabian-kostadinov.github.io/2015/01/16/how-to-find-a-github-team-id).
In `config` you should also modify the `orcid.yml` file to list your site as the production site.

Optionally, you can edit `seeds.rb`, a file in the `db` folder.
"DB" is short for "database," and this file _seeds_ the database with information about your editorial team.
You can edit the file `seeds.rb` to remove any individuals who are not editors in your organization.
This file will be updated later as you add information in the application, so this step is not strictly necessary.

Finally, you'll need to set up a [GitHub webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks) for reviews repository.
This should be a repository that you have write access to,
where you expect most of the reviewer-author interaction to occur.
For JOSS, this corresponds to the `openjournals/joss-reviews` GitHub repository.

In this GitHub repository's settings,
you can add a new webhook with the following configuration:

- Set the `Payload` URL to the `/dispatch` hook for your Heroku application URL.
  For example, https://neurolibre.herokuapp.com/dispatch
- Set the `Content type` to `application/json`
- Set the secret to a high-entropy, random string as detailed in the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/securing-your-webhooks#setting-your-secret-token)
- Set the webhook to deliver `all events`

### Modifying your site contents

You can modify site content by updating files in the `app` and `docs` folders.
For example, in `app/views/notifications` you can change the text for any emails that will be sent by your application.

Note that files which end in `.html.erb` are treated as HTML files, and typical HTML formatting applies.
You can set the HTML styling by modifying the Sass files for your application,
located in `app/assets/stylesheets`.

There are currently a few hard-coded variables in the application which you will also need to update.
Note that these are mostly under `lib/tasks`.
For example, in `stats.rake`, the reviewer sheet ID is hard-coded on line 37.
You should update this to point to your own spreadsheet where you maintain a list of eligible reviewers.

In the same folder, `utils.rake` is currently hard-coded to alternate assignments of editor-in-chief based on weeks.
You should modify this to either set a single editor-in-chief,
or design your own scheme of alternating between members of your editorial board.

## Deploying your Whedon-API Application

Whedon-API can also be deployed on Heroku.
Note that &mdash; for full functionality &mdash; Whedon-API must be deployed on [Hobby dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-types), rather than free dynos.
Hobby dynos allow the Whedon-API application to run continuously, without falling asleep after 30 minutes of inactivity;
this means that Whedon-API can respond to activity on GitHub at any time.
Whedon-API specifically requires two Hobby dynos: one for the `web` service and one for the `worker` service.

On the Whedon-API Heroku deployment, you'll need to provision several [add-ons](https://elements.heroku.com/addons).
Specifically, you'll need:

1. [Cloudinary add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/cloudinary)
1. [PostgreSQL add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql),
1. [Scheduler add-on](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler)
1. [Redis To Go add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/redistogo)

For the scheduler add-on, you'll need to designate which tasks it should run and when.
The only task that needs to be scheduled is the `restart.sh` script,
which should be set to execute every hour.

```eval_rst
.. warn:
    Cloudinary `does not allow free accounts to serve PDFs <https://cloudinary.com/blog/uploading_managing_and_delivering_pdfs#delivering_pdf_files>`_ by default.
    This will prevent your application from offering a paper preview service, as in https://whedon.theoj.org
    To have this restriction lifted, you will need to `contact Cloudinary customer support <https://support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/requests/new>`_ directly.
```

As before, once you've pushed your application to Heroku and provisioned the appropriate add-ons,
you're ready to update your config with the appropriate secrets.
For a list of the expected secret key names, see the `app.json` file.
Many of these will be re-used from deploying your JOSS application.

Specifically, the `GH_TOKEN` should be the same personal access token as before.
The `JOSS_API_KEY` should match the `WHEDON_SECRET` key that you created in your JOSS deployment.

You'll also need to provide a `HEROKU_APP_NAME`, `HEROKU_CLI_TOKEN`, and `HEROKU_CLI_USER` that the `restart.sh` script can use when executing.
You can find these directly from the heroku-cli as detailed in [their documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/authentication).

## Modifying your Whedon-API deployment

Some times you may not want to launch an exact copy of the Whedon-API, but a modified version.
This can be especially useful if you're planning to spin up your own platform based on the
Open Journals framework.
[RoboNeuro](https://github.com/roboneuro) is one such example use-case.

### Modifying your Whedon-API configuration

Similar to the JOSS deployment described above,
the Whedon-API configuration is controlled through a series of YAML files included in the `config/` folder.
Each of these files provide relevant configuration for a different development context.
Specifically, two files are defined:

1. `settings-test.yml`
1. `settings-production.yml`

which can be used to define testing and production environment variables, respectively.
Much of the information [previously defined for your JOSS deployment](#modifying-your-site-configuration) will carry over,
including the editor team ID.

Finally, you'll need to set up a [GitHub webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks) for your reviews repository.
As a reminder, this should be a repository that you have write access to.
For JOSS, this corresponds to the `openjournals/joss-reviews` GitHub repository.
**This is in addition to the webhook you previously created for the JOSS deployment,
although it points to the same repository.**

In this GitHub repository's settings,
you can add a new webhook with the following configuration:

- Set the `Payload` URL to the `/dispatch` hook for your Heroku application URL.
  For example, https://roboneuro.herokuapp.com/dispatch
- Set the `Content type` to `application/json`
- Set the secret to a high-entropy, random string as detailed in the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/securing-your-webhooks#setting-your-secret-token)
- Set the webhook to deliver `all events`
