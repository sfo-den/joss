As such, the <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> community adheres to a code of conduct adapted from the <%= link_to "Contributor Covenant", "http://contributor-covenant.org", :target => "_blank" %> code of conduct.</p>

        <p>Authors and reviewers will be required to confirm they have read our <%= link_to "code of conduct", "https://github.com/#{ setting(:github) }/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md", :target => "_blank" %>, and are expected to adhere to it in all <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> spaces and associated interactions.</p>

          <li>Waiting for reviewers to be assigned over in <%= link_to "https://github.com/#{Rails.application.settings["reviews"]}", "https://github.com/#{Rails.application.settings["reviews"]}", :target => "_blank" %></li>

        <h2>What does a typical review process look like?</h2>

        <p>We encourage you to familiarize yourself with our <%= link_to "reviewer guidelines", "#reviewer_guidelines" %> as this will help you understand what our reviewers will be looking for. Broadly speaking though, provided you have followed our pre-submission steps and meet our submission requirements then you should expect a rapid review (typically less than two weeks).</p>

        <p>After submission:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One or more <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> reviewers are assigned and the review is carried out in the <%= link_to "reviews repository", "https://github.com/#{Rails.application.settings["reviews"]}", :target => "_blank" %></li>
          <li>Authors respond to reviewer-raised issues (if any are raised) on the submitted repository's issue tracker.  Reviewer contributions, like any other contributions, should be acknowledged in the repository.</li>
          <li>Upon successful completion of the review, deposit a copy of your (updated) repository with a data-archiving service such as <%= link_to "Zenodo", "https://zenodo.org/", :target => "_blank" %> or <%= link_to "figshare", "https://figshare.com/", :target => "_blank" %>, issue a DOI for the archive, and update the review issue thread with your DOI.</li>
          <li>After assignment of a DOI, your paper metadata is deposited in CrossRef and listed on the <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> website.</li>
          <li>And that's it.</li>

          <p><%= setting(:name) %> is an open access journal <em>committed to running at minimal costs, with zero publication fees (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_processing_charge">article processing charges</a>) or subscription fees</em>.</p>
          <p>Under the NumFOCUS nonprofit umbrella, <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> is now eligible to seek grants for sustaining its future. With an entirely volunteer team, <%= setting(:abbreviation) %> is seeking to sustain its operations via donations and grants, keeping its low cost of operation and free service for authors.</p>

          <p>In the spirit of transparency, below is an outline of our current running costs:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Annual Crossref <a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/20pub_fees.html">membership</a>: $275 / year</li>

            <li><%= setting(:abbreviation) %> website hosting (Heroku): $19 / month</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Assuming a publication rate of 200 papers per year this works out at ~$3.50 per paper ((19*12) + 200 + 275) / 200 .</p>
