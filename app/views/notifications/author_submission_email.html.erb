Hello there, thanks for your submission to <em><%= Rails.application.settings['abbreviation'] %></em>.
<br />
Your paper, <em>'<%= @paper.title %>'</em>, is currently awaiting triage by our managing editor. This generally takes between 24 and 72 hours and until then, your paper won't show up in the https://github.com/<%= Rails.application.settings['reviews'] %> repository.
<br />

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, <%= Rails.application.settings['abbreviation'] %> is currently operating in a reduced service mode. More details about what this means for authors, editors, and reviewers is available in <%= link_to "this blog post", "https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2020/05/reopening-joss" %>, but in short, authors should anticipate a significantly longer review period than before and your patience is appreciated.
<br />

You can view the latest status of your paper here: <%= @url %>

Many thanks<br />
The <%= Rails.application.settings['abbreviation'] %> editorial robot.
